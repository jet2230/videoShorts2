[done] 0. I am going to create a automatic youtube shorts creation app
[done] 1. create a pyton script that will download a youtube video given the url in its highest quality
[done] 2. the video will be placed in a specific folder structre like the following videos/001_<video title>/ replace the <video title> with the title of the video and increment 001 to 002 after each new video is downloaded. Folder numbering uses max(existing_number) + 1 logic, only counting folders that contain actual video files (mp4, mkv, webm). Deleted folder numbers are never reused - the next folder always increments from the highest existing numbered folder.
[done] 3. use whisper to create subtitles for the video, the video will be multi lingual with the majority being in English, wisper will transliterate the forien language words.
[done] 4. create a text file called 'video info.txt' within the downloaded folder, and add information about this video like the title and the download url.
[done] 5. read the subtitles file and create specifc themes to make youtube short videos, the themes must be within the timelines of 30secs to 4min and must make sense.  Save the list of the themes in a file called themes.md
[done] 6. list all the themes at the start of themes.md, then can provide the descripions after that
[done] 7. Theme names must be proper themes names based on the context of the text
[done] 8. allow locally saved video files to be processed, where they will be copied to their appropriate folder structure inside the project. For locally saved videos make the video filename the folder name, and in the video info.txt have 'local video source (not downloaded from youtube)'.
[done] 9. Add AI theme title generation using Llama 3 via Ollama (optional --ai flag)
[done] 10. add ability to create the youtube short video by video and theme number identifier, i.e. for example to create the youtube short for video 001 theme 2 I will execute shorts_creator.py 001 --theme=2 or for themes 1, 2, 5 I'll do shorts_creator.py 001 --theme=1,2,5 or to make shorts for all the themes for that video I'll do shorts_creator.py 001 --theme=all.  If you have a smater shorter method of doing this make suggestions.
[done] 11. Fix shorts video creation: 1) Set aspect ratio to 9:16 (YouTube Shorts format), 2) Burn subtitles into the video file
[done] 12. remove the huge black padding it looks really bad, just cut the video to proper ratio.
[done] 13. reduce the subtitles font size and with height 35 from the bottom.
[done] 14. the subtitles are not working properly on the short video.
[done] 15. when creating the short video leave the subtitle file in the same folder as the short video.
